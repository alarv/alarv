### Hi there ðŸ§ ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex (he/they), a Machine Learning Engineer focused on deploying ML models, building neural networks, and fine-tuning LLMs. I work on real-world systems that are fast, scalable, and actually used.

Currently at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), working on ML infrastructure, LLMs, and deep learning model deployments.

I also like solving weird bugs, talking code structure, and occasionally doing stand-up comedy.

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:alex.arvanitidis0@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Hello!) and talk about coding, ML, gaming, comedy, or plants ðŸª´
