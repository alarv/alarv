### Hi there ðŸ¦¸ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex (he/they) ðŸŒŸ, a software aficionado with a keen eye for design! My world is a vibrant tapestry of code, greenery ðŸŒ¿, melodies ðŸŽµ, and the thrill of puzzle-solving ðŸ§©

I'm currently working at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) as a Senior Software Engineer, specializing in full-stack development. I also enjoy delving deep into technologies like Machine Learning and Kubernetes.

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:alex.arvanitidis0@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Hello!) and talk about coding, gaming, comedy or plants! ðŸª´
